VIP-13
Status: Pending

## Summary

Whitelist Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche chains for pools in the Vesper ecosystem and MATIC, FTM and AVAX as new deposit assets.

## Abstract

Vesper seeks to expand its ecosystem by launching its pools on popular EVM chains to offer more choices and benefits for the Vesper user, principally the reduction of transaction costs. Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Avalanche have established DeFi ecosystems that enable Vesper to integrate easily. 

In addition, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche have native tokens that are candidates for Vesper pools. 
Expectations

This proposal greenlights the creation of Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche and Arbitrum Vesper satellites. In addition, this will approve MATIC, FTM and AVAX to be used as deposit assets. As an initial step, Vesper pools are already undergoing beta testing on Polygon as of Oct. 12, 2021.
 
## Specification

Whitelist Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche and Arbitrum satellites for production. 
Whitelist MATIC, FTM and AVAX tokens.
