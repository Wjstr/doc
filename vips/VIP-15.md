# Vesper Orbit

VIP-15
Status: Passed

## Summary

Many tokens seen as exciting, controversial, or possessing high potential are barred integration from Vesper because they lack integration on other DeFi protocols. This VIP proposes "Vesper Orbit", an off-shoot Vesper application and associated Rari Fuse pool that can incubate these tokens and create the yield sources needed for integration into the Vesper ecosystem.

## Background Research

See #34 

## Abstract

Vesper Orbit is a “degen friendly” offshoot of the Vesper application that does not adhere to the same requirements for auditing and safety as the flagship products. Vesper Orbit would play a similar role to Yearn’s Ape.tax platform. Vesper Orbit is a concept that has been proposed by Jeff Garzik and discussed several times in Discord over the past several months.

Vesper Orbit exists as a standalone Rari Fuse lending market (Fuse#11) and a set of pools found at a special orbit domain (ie orbit.vesper.finance). Vesper Orbit will not surface on either the main marketing or application websites, and will only be accessible to users “in the know”.

Vesper Orbit will carry fees similarly to the main set of products (at a performance and withdrawal fee to be determined later) and follow the same revenue split model as other products under the Vesper Umbrella. Tokens and strategies can graduate from Vesper Orbit to the beta or main app if they qualify under the same standards as other pools and tokens.

Whitelisting is not required for Vesper Orbit. However, we've pinpointed a number of tokens that look interesting for Vesper Orbit and not quite ready for Whitelisting to the main Vesper app. Those tokens include, but are not limited to:

- HEX
- PUNK-BASIC
- SHIB
- ALGD
- AXS
- DOLA
- INV
- AMPL
- renDOGE
- TOKE
- KLIMA
- MIST
- TRU

## Specification

- Create Vesper Orbit pools application at orbit.vesper.finance (or similar domain)
- Vesper to support tokens under Vesper Orbit as deemed apt.
